#
# Allows for modifying certain aspects of vanilla enchantments
#
enabled: false # There may be potential conflicts if modifying vanilla enchantments.

# Set custom max levels for vanilla enchantments.
# To do this, add each enchantment like this:
# - "<key>:4"
# For example, to allow efficiency 6 and protection 5, you would do this:
# max-levels:
#   - "efficiency:6"
#   - "protection:5"
#
# Currently, it is *not* possible to modify the enchantment levels from enchanting tables.
# It will work with anvils however, but since it is still possible to get enchantments at their vanilla
# max levels, then it isn't recommended to lower the max level of a vanilla enchantment, only to raise it.
