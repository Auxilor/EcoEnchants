rarities:
  # Table Probability is the chance of getting enchantment as a percentage from an enchanting table
  # Minimum Level is the minimum xp level you have to be to get the enchantment
  # You can add more rarities by following the pattern.
  # Remember, enchantments are more likely to be high-level the closer they are to maximum-obtainable-level
  # Villager probability is the chance of a villager having this trade as a percentage. Vanilla default for all enchantments is 2.7%, however you can choose this per-rarity.
  # Loot probability is the chance of an item in a loot chest having this enchantment as a percentage

  # Custom Color is a custom name color for all enchantments of rarity to have
  # This is disabled by default.
  # Curses override this, and always display in their specified color.
