drops:
  ### ADVANCED OPTIONS
  force-dropqueue: true
  # When combined with collate, this massively reduces calls to getItemMeta, which can hurt performance when many enchants are on an item.
  # Without collate, the number of calls may be increased - which will further hurt performance
  # Enabling this option makes all drops go through telekinesis listeners

advanced:
  lore-getter:
    # This converts enchantments with matching names from other enchantment plugins from lore into real enchantments.
    # This is experimental not recommended to be used for extended periods of time: enchantments are automatically converted.
    # Only use this if absolutely necessary as it may cause some bugs.
    enabled: false
    aggressive: false
    # Aggressive mode converts all items in all inventories when opened.
    # This will most likely have a significant performance penalty.
  hide-fixer:
    # Fixes some items obtained in older versions with a bug that caused enchantments to be hidden.
    # Works both in packets to display the enchants to the client as well as changing the server-side item too.
    # Only use this option if you've encountered this bug as it may strip HideEnchants from items that you might not expect it to.
    enabled: false
    aggressive: false
    # Aggressive mode converts all items in all inventories whenever revealed.
    # This may impact performance.
